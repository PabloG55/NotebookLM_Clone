# ThinkBook 🧠

ThinkBook is a powerful, self-hosted **NotebookLM Clone** that lets you ground an AI in your own data. Upload documents, ingest URLs, and transform your notes into summaries, interactive quizzes, or even a full 2-person podcast with audio.

Built with **FastAPI**, **Gradio**, **ChromaDB**, and powered by **Groq** for lightning-fast inference.

## Key Features

- **Document Ingestion:** Support for PDF, PPTX, TXT, and Web URLs.
- **Vector Search:** RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) powered by ChromaDB.
- **AI Chat:** Instant answers based strictly on your notebook content.
- **Podcast Generation:** Converts documents into a realistic 2-person dialogue with high-quality TTS audio.
- **Study Tools:** AI-generated quizzes with grading and full study guides with flashcards.
- **User Persistence:** Integrates with Hugging Face OAuth for per-user data isolation and persistent storage.

4. **Configure Environment:**
   Copy the example environment file and add your keys:

   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Edit .env and paste your GROQ_API_KEY
   ```

5. **Start the Application:**
   Run the startup script which launches both the FastAPI backend and the Gradio frontend:

## GitHub Setup & CI/CD

To host this project on GitHub and automatically sync it to Hugging Face:

1. **Create a GitHub Repository:** Go to [github.com/new](https://github.com/new) and create a repository named `NotebookLM_Clone`.
2. **Push to GitHub:**
   ```bash
   git remote add github https://github.com/PabloG55/NotebookLM_Clone.git
   git push github main
   ```
3. **Configure CI/CD Secrets:**
   In your GitHub repository:
   - Go to **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**.
   - Add a **New repository secret**:
     - **Name:** `HF_TOKEN`
     - **Value:** (Your Hugging Face **Write** token).

Every time you push to the `main` branch on GitHub, the GitHub Action will automatically update your Hugging Face Space.
